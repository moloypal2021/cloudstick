        <h6 class="text-sm sm:text-base text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h6>

        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22.1 Use of Arbitration</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-6">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and CloudStick
            in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and CloudStick agree that any and all disputes arising
            in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than
            a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more
            limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
            the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not
            limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract,
            tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims
            arise during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO
            THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDSTICK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
            ACTION. <br>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
            otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue
            enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available,
            (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address
            intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22.2 Arbitrator</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-12">Any arbitration between you and CloudStick will be governed by
            the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration
            Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and
            filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. <br>
            22.3 Notice and Process <br>
            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by
            certified mail or, in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail
            ("Notice"). <br>
            CloudStick's address for Notice is: <br>
            CloudStick LLC, 651 N Broad St #205-1557, Suite 205, Middletown, DE 19709. <br>
            The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific
            relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not
            reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CloudStick may commence an
            arbitration proceeding. </p>

        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">2.4 Fees</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-12">Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be
            agreed upon in the State of Washington provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose
            whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;
            (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by
            the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose
            (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
            fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse CloudStick for all monies
            previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
            manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision
            sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
            based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
            expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
            arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
        </p>


        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22.5 No Class Actions</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-12">YOU AND CLOUDSTICK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
            OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
            OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CloudStick agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
            not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
            representative or class proceeding.</p>


        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22.6 Modifications</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-12">In the event that CloudStick makes any future change to this
            arbitration provision (other than a change to CloudStick's address for Notice), you may reject any such
            change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to CloudStick's address for Notice, in
            which case your account with CloudStick will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision as in
            effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive. </p>

        <h6 class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 font-semibold mb-6">22.7 Enforceability</h6>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-dark-1 mb-12">If Subsection 22.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the
            entirety of this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 22 will be null
            and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section
            20 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement</p>
